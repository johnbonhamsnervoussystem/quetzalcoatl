This is an electronic structure code I am writing for my own research and edification.  Starting on this project 
it surprised me at how many basic things related to electronic structure theory could not be quickly found online 
and integrated into my own code.  Consequently I am undergoing an unnecessary rite of passage in making these things 
for myself.

I hope that my implementation is straightforward to understand with minimal study and can be quickly used to start your own project. Any routine for which I would like credit will be explicitly included in that routine.  I will also try to add in proper citations for things that should be cited.  Otherwise, please borrow, copy, distribute, modify and refine anything you find
and make availible for public use.

If you would like to share code with me or have any improvements to this code send it my way.  Thanks!
