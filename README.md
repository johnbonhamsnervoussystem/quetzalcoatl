This is an electronic structure code I am writing for my own research and edification.  Starting on this project 
it surprised me at how many basic things related to electronic structure theory could not be quickly found online 
and integrated into my own code.  Consequently I am undergoing an unnecessary rite of passage in making these things 
for myself.

Any code you find here should absolutely be publicaly availible for anyone who wants to do these calculations.  Much
for this material I am copying from other pieces of code I have found through my searchs and development.  Any routine
for which I would like credit will be explcitly included in that routine.  Otherwise, please borrow, copy, distribute, 
modify and refine anything you find and make availible for public use.  Don't let others waste their time on routines here.

If you would like to share code with me or have any improvements to this code send it my way.  Thanks!
