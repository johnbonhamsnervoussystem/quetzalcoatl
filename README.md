This is an electronic structure code I am writing for my own research and edification.  Starting on this project 
it surprised me at how many basic things related to electronic structure theory could not be quickly found online 
and integrated into my own code.  Consequently I am undergoing an unnecessary rite of passage in making these things 
for myself.

Any code you find here should absolutely be publicaly availible for anyone who wants to do these calculations.  Much
of this material I am copying the structure from other pieces of code I have found or long established algorithms.  
Since it is generally easier to read your own code rather than other people's code and other code is often wrapped up
in datastructures I am adapting for myself.  Hopefully my implementation is straightforward to understand with minimal
study and can be quickly used to start your own project. Any routine for which I would like credit will be explicitly 
included in that routine.  Otherwise, please please please borrow, copy, distribute, modify and refine anything you find
and make availible for public use.  Don't let others waste their time on routines here.

If you would like to share code with me or have any improvements to this code send it my way.  Thanks!
